          Hi, I'm Patrick and this is my cookie creation. My family has been in the cookie making business for over 60 years. Time after time we come up with new and revolutionary cookie recipes. And this time, I have taken Seattlites two favorite things and combined them. Fish, and coffee! Now I present to you my one and only, "Salmon Cookies". I have found the perfect concoction of freshly ground up salmon and the perfected coffee brew.
